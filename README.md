# Memory Game Project

This project was created for udacity`s nanodegree project, the most interesting part is that I created a HashMap for storing cards, so there is no full array scan, every operation is done in O(1) :D

## Usage
You can play online going to:
[link](https://jrabello.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/)

In this game you have to guess two cards from the same class into a board full of pairs of cards

Try to get as much as possible stars in less time, cards are not visible, so it`s great way to train your memory!
